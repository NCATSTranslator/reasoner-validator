This package provides software methods to Translator components (e.g. Knowledge Providers and Autonomous Relay Agents) using *any version* of the [Translator Reasoner API (TRAPI)](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI/blob/master/README.md) and the [Biolink Model](https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model/blob/master/README.md).

See [the full documentation](https://ncatstranslator.github.io/reasoner-validator/) and [the contributor guidelines](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/reasoner-validator/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Using the Package

## Installing the Module

The module may be installed directly from pypi.org.

```bash
pip install reasoner-validator
```

## Installing and working with the module locally from source

As of release 3.1.6, this project uses the [hatch project management](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) tool to orchestrate its installation and dependencies.

After [installing hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install) and cloning the project, the packages installation and syncing will be handled automatically by hatch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/reasoner-validator.git
cd reasoner-validator
```

### Build the Documentation Locally

To build the documentation locally:

```bash
hatch run docs
```

### Running the tests

To run the tests locally:

```bash
hatch run test
```

### Entering an environment

You can enter an environment automatically created by `hatch` with all dependencies installed by using:

```bash
hatch shell
```

### Resetting the environments

In case you are having issues with packages not getting updated properly, you can reset the environments with:

```bash
hatch env prune
```

## Validation Run as a Web Service

The Reasoner Validator is available wrapped as a simple web service.  The service may be run directly or as a Docker container.

### API

The web service has a single POST endpoint `/validate` taking a simple JSON request body, as follows:

```json
{
  "trapi_version": "1.3.0",
  "biolink_version": "3.0.3",
  "sources": {
    "ara_source": "infores:aragorn",
    "kp_source": "infores:panther",
    "kp_source_type": "primary"
  },
  "strict_validation": true,
  "message": {...}
}
```

The request body consists of JSON data structure with two top level tag:

- An **optional** `trapi_version` tag can be given a value of the TRAPI version against which the message will be validated, expressed as a SemVer string (defaults to 'latest' if omitted; partial SemVer strings are resolved to their 'latest' minor and patch releases). 
- An **optional** `biolink_version` tag can be given a value of the Biolink Model version against which the message knowledge graph semantic contents will be validated, expressed as a SemVer string (defaults to 'latest' Biolink Model Toolkit supported version, if omitted). 
- An **optional** `sources` with an object dictionary (example shown) specifying the ARA and KP sources involved in the TRAPI call (specified by infores CURIE) and the expected KP provenance source type, i.e. 'primary' implies that the KP is tagged as a 'biolink:primary_knowledge_source'. Optional in that the root "sources" or any of the subsidiary tags may be omitted (default to None)
- An **optional** `strict_validation` flag (default: None or 'false'). If 'true' then follow strict validation rules, such as treating as 'error' states the use of `category`, `predicate` and `attribute_type_id` that are of type `abstract` or `mixin`  as errors. 
- A **mandatory** `message` tag should have as its value the complete TRAPI **Message** JSON data structure to be validated (see example below).

### Running the Web Service Directly

The service may be run directly as a Python module. The web services module may be directly run, as follows. 

```shell
python -m api.main
```

Note that you can deploy it with `hatch`:

```shell
hatch run api --port 80
```

Go to  http://localhost/docs to see the service documentation and to use the simple UI to input TRAPI messages for validation.

### Typical Output

As an example of the kind of output to expect, if one posts the following JSON message data to the **/validate** endpoint:

```json
{
  "trapi_version": "1.3.0",
  "biolink_version": "3.0.3",
  "message": {
    "query_graph": {
        "nodes": {
            "type-2 diabetes": {"ids": ["MONDO:0005148"]},
            "drug": {"categories": ["biolink:Drug"]}
        },
        "edges": {
            "treats": {"subject": "drug", "predicates": ["biolink:treats"], "object": "type-2 diabetes"}
        }
    },
    "knowledge_graph": {
        "nodes": {
            "MONDO:0005148": {"name": "type-2 diabetes"},
            "CHEBI:6801": {"name": "metformin", "categories": ["biolink:Drug"]}
        },
        "edges": {
            "df87ff82": {"subject": "CHEBI:6801", "predicate": "biolink:treats", "object": "MONDO:0005148"}
        }
    },
    "results": [
        {
            "node_bindings": {
                "type-2 diabetes": [{"id": "MONDO:0005148"}],
                "drug": [{"id": "CHEBI:6801"}]
            },
            "edge_bindings": {
                "treats": [{"id": "df87ff82"}]
            }
        }
    ]
  }
}
```

one should typically get a response body like the following JSON validation result back:

```json
{
  "trapi_version": "1.3.0",
  "biolink_version": "3.0.3",
  "report": [
    {
      "code": "warning.node.unmapped_prefix",
      "node_id": "CHEBI:6801",
      "categories": "['biolink:Drug']"
    },
    {
      "code": "error.node.missing_categories",
      "node_id": "MONDO:0005148"
    },
    {
      "code": "error.edge.attribute.missing"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Running the Web Service within Docker

The Reasoner Validator web service may be run inside a docker container, using Docker Compose.

First, from the root project directory, build the local docker container

```shell
docker-compose build
```

Then, run the service:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Once again, go to  http://localhost/docs to see the service documentation.

To stop the service:

```shell
docker-compose down
```

Of course, the above docker-compose commands may be customized by the user to suit their needs. Note that the docker implementation assumes the use of uvicorn

## Change Log

Summary of earlier releases and current Change Log is [here](CHANGELOG.md).

## Code Limitations (implied Future Work?)

- Biolink Model release <= 2.4.8 versus 3.0.0 validation: the reasoner-validator uses the Biolink Model Toolkit. As it happens, the toolkit is not backwards compatible with at least one Biolink Model structural change from release 2.#.# to 3.#.#: the tagging of 'canonical' predicates. That is, the 0.8.10++ toolkit reports canonical <= 2.4.8 model predicates as 'non-canonical'.
- This release of the Reasoner Validator Web Service will detect TRAPI 1.0.* releases but doesn't strive to be completely backwards compatible with them (considering that that TRAPI 1.0.* is totally irrelevant now). 
- The web service validation doesn't do deep validation of the Results part of a TRAPI Message
- The validation is only run on the first 1000 nodes and 100 edges of graphs, to keep the validation time tractable (this risks not having complete coverage of the graph)
- Biolink Model toolkit is not (yet) cached so changing the model version during use will result in some latency in results
- The validator service doesn't (yet) deeply validate non-core node and edge slot contents of Message Knowledge Graphs
- The validator service doesn't (yet) attempt validation of Query Graph nodes and edges 'constraints' (e.g. `biolink:Association` etc. `domain` and `range` constraints)
- Query Graph node 'ids' are not validated except when an associated 'categories' parameter is provided for the given node. In general, [Query Graph Validation](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/reasoner-validator/issues/14) could be elaborated.
- The system should leverage the [Reasoner Pydantic Models](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/reasoner-validator/issues/15)
